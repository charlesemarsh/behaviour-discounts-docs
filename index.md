# Behaviour Discounts

Behaviour Discounts helps you offer dynamic incentives based on what customers actually do—browse, engage, abandon, purchase, and return. Use it to steer user behaviour with targeted discounts, free shipping, credits, or loyalty boosts without blanket promotions.

## Quick start

1. Clarify the journey you want to influence (e.g., complete first purchase, recover abandoned cart, reward repeat buyers).
2. Map the events and attributes you can observe (page views, cart contents, purchase totals, loyalty tier, geo, device).
3. Define discount rules and guardrails in your environment. See [Getting started](guides/getting-started.md).
4. Test in staging with sample events before turning on for production. See [Rollout checklist](guides/rollout.md).
5. Monitor conversion, margin impact, and abuse signals; iterate with tighter conditions.
