# Behaviour Discounts

Behaviour Discounts helps you offer dynamic incentives based on what customers actually do like browse, engage, abandon, purchase, and return. Use it to steer user behaviour and win that conversion with targeted discounts, free shipping or loyalty boosts without blanket promotions.

## Quick start, creating Behaviour Triggers

1. Define the customer action you want to trigger — for example, completing a first purchase, returning to finish an abandoned basket, or rewarding loyal, repeat buyers.

## Quick start, creating Magic Links

1.	Create a special link that includes a discount. When a customer clicks the link, the discount is automatically applied in their cart — no codes to remember or enter.

2.	Share this link anywhere you like, such as emails, SMS, ads, or QR codes, to send customers straight into a discounted shopping experience.
