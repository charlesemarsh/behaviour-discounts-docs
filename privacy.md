# Privacy

This page explains how Behaviour Discounts handles data for the product and this documentation site. It is not legal advice—adapt it to your policies and jurisdictional requirements.

## What we collect

- **Product events you send:** Behaviour and commerce events (e.g., cart viewed, checkout started, order completed) with related attributes you choose to include (cart value, items, coupon usage, geo, device, loyalty tier).  
- **Identifiers:** User and session identifiers you provide (e.g., user ID, email, device ID, session ID) to evaluate eligibility and issue discounts.  
- **Discount records:** Issued codes, validity windows, redemption status, and the rule that generated them.  
- **Logs and metrics:** Operational logs and aggregate metrics (trigger volume, redemption rates, error logs) for monitoring and debugging.  
- **Documentation site:** This site is static and does not set cookies. Standard web server logs (IP address, user agent, referrer) may be retained briefly for security and reliability.

## How data is used

- Evaluate rules and guardrails to decide when a discount should be issued.
- Deliver and track discounts (issue, apply, redeem) and prevent abuse (stacking, excessive redemptions).
- Monitor performance (conversion, AOV, margin impact) and reliability (error rates, latency).
- Improve the product through aggregated, de-identified analytics when possible.

## Data sharing

- We do not sell or rent data.
- Data is only shared with subprocessors needed to operate the service (e.g., email/SMS delivery, infrastructure, observability). Keep an internal register of any vendors you configure.
- Access to production data is restricted to authorized personnel for support and operations.

## Security

- Transport encryption (HTTPS/TLS) is required for all event and management traffic.
- Apply least-privilege access controls for operators and automation.
- Regularly review audit logs for rule changes, access, and discount issuance.

## Retention and deletion

- Keep event and issuance data only as long as needed to operate rules, monitor impact, and meet audit requirements.
- Set retention periods for logs and backups; expire old issued codes where supported.
- Respond to deletion requests for identifiable data in accordance with your legal obligations.

## Your responsibilities

- Ensure you have a lawful basis to send personal data (consent, contract, legitimate interest).
- Avoid sending sensitive personal data unless necessary and permitted.
- Update this policy to reflect your actual data flows, subprocessors, and applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
